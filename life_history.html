      <p class="history">i was born in march 27 200  in a poor family my father's job is a security guard in south mall las pinas and my mother is a house wife and we lived in the squaters area in the early age i know that i want to lift up in life my parents and the path ahaed is very hard.
       The most oldest history of my life that i remember is when i was 3 years old having a simple birth day party with a special guest which is tita bebeth , i remember some people and it was very a happy memory 
       and i remember the name of my first friend  and fast forward is when i was a nursery student, there is somthing happened to me very strangely that is in my head i feel that i was having a flash back from my memories of the past, i feel like i was drag down  from being a babay to a nursery student.   
      by the time when i was in kindergatern i was in the top of the class thanks to my mom who helps me in my study thanks to mom that i was first honor in kinder garten. Unfortunately the medals that i recieved was gone by flood undoy. We lost our house the only thing left in our house was the foundation of the house 
      . fast forward i had a great start when i was in grade 1  but in the mids of the school year i had a fever in fisrt we thought that it is only normal fever until the fever has been one week and my parents decided to check me up and thats what they found that i have a dengue and i was in the hospital for one or two months i think 
      beacuse of the dengue it affect my study i got to lower section until grade 5. i start selling sack bag in the public market when i was in grade 4 because the class are only half day.  in grade 5 come back is real because excell my studies and i come second honor in the class.  
      fast forward to grade 6 this is the start of my worst stages in life  because in the whole school year i was bullied by my classmates and i dont have the courage to tell my parents of whats going on and keep on studying while selling in the afternoon.
      fast forward to highchool, ih highchool 'the time when the world is not on your shoulder, its on your head'. Grade 7 i am still being bullied by the bullies in the classroom. The only i like my school is to go home because i was a lone weak wolf and i have experience being a stalker not in a bad way because i just want someone go home together from school.
      in first  i was shy just low key following her to go home bacause we live in the same street her house is one block away from us from the time being she notice me that i was following her and she talks to me and i explained why i was following her and she also said that its okay because she also has no one to go home together from school and     
      the next day when i was waiting for her she approach me  and she bring me to her three friennds  and she introduce me to her three friends in class. but sadly for me, 'this girl is pinag tagpo lang kami pero d tinadhan'. because in grade 8 even it is the most momerable year of my life. 
      the girl that i was with when going home from scholl, she change i guess people do change but even shes not with me going home from school but her friends in grade 7 is the ones that i go home with me from school. one of her friends is i like shes to one who made my heart skip a beat lets just call her by the name <span style="color:red">❤❤ KIM ❤❤</span> at first i like to watch her from not so far and i like to hang out with her but sadly i dont have the courage to tell her that i have feelings for her 
      and what will happend if i tell her how i feel so i keep it to the end and i want to tell her how i feel in the sem break of the school year but sadly I didn't reach the end sem break because my father decided to to the province and thats the end of my crush story.
      and i was transfer in alegria national highschool in my first week in school i was a celebrity many girls ask me to have a pic with them, and for me in my head i said wow 'sana all sikat' but all of the attention i got has dissapered, in this world nothing is permanent changes is the only permanent, the difference of quality of the lessons in the province compare to manila is in the province is lesson is behind from manila, But i excell my study.
      and in the province the sem break is i dont like because we go to the mointain to harvest tiger grass for the first time we climb the mountain i said to my self that i dont want this job i want my job is to hold light weights and my father said that 'if you do not finish your school and gruaduate this will be your life ' and so thats why i keep on figthing for life to get a decent job so that i will not go to the mountain and live there. fast forward to senior highschool
      they said that in senior highschool that they will prepare us for the collage, but why is our teacher doesn't come to teach us in his/her time while we see her/his comming in other class, whats that favoritism??
      and because of covid 19 i am not prepared for the collage. and iam a member in MCGI since 11-22-19. fast forward to collage i am now enrolled in laverdad christian collage school and  i survive the first year online class. and currently i am a second year student with the course of BSIS  and with
      by God's grace, I will finish my studies to help my parents
